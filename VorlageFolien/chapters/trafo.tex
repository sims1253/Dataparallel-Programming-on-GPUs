\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Important Details!}
Lets be honest, no one can really understand the stuff in detail in 30 minutes as you know!
\begin{itemize}
\item So lets sketch stuff so everyone can understand the details.
\item Point out the really important stuff!
\item Pictures, gestures and everything else might help, but do not exaggerate!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Important Results!}
Lets show the people that the implementation is cool! 
But diagrams are generally not drawn well, because:
\begin{itemize}
\item they do not depict the important result! show the important stuff, you want to tell!
\item they do not relate to the implementation!
\item their axis titles cannot be read in most cases. Need big fonts!
\item thir lines are not visible as color and size are not set appropriate.
\item their axis titles are not descriptive and do not have any dimension!
\item their lines are to close! You cannot really distinguish between results!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
